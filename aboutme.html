								<h2>Summary</h2>
								<p>Honesty. Creativity. Passion. These personality traits describe me as a person and also relay to employers that I bring more
									than just intellect to the table. My outgoing personality and honesty give me an edge that other students don't have. I always
									give each challenge my all, and after I finish the challenge I always make a note to reflect on what I could've done better.</p>
								<p>I chose computer science as my challenge and hope to obtain the skills necessary to succeed at one of North America's leading
									technology centers. Computer science is not just a field of study, it is an art. Everyone in this field has different ways of
									solving a problem, but which way is the most correct? This has been a debatable subject but I feel like the best solutions to
									a compute science problem are dynamic. Dynamic solutions are able to adapt to specific consumer needs and are able to compensate
									for any changes that may occur. Just as in art there are different ways to express ones self, computer science also shares that
									same sentiment. This is the philosophy I hope to adapt to my work in the real world!</p>
						
								<h2>Other interesting things about me</h2>
								<p>I think one thing that everyone who knows me will tell you is that I'm a huge Arsenal fan! Arsenal is football (soccer) club in North London
									and they play at the Emirates Stadium. I had the pleasure of visiting my family in the UK during the winter break and had a chance to see
								Arsenal play live at the Emirates! It was definitely the highlight of my trip and one of the coolest moments in my life! In fact, when I was in front of the stadium
								I got interviewed by a TV crew, which was an amazing experience (see below)!</p>

								<p> Other than Arsenal, I'm a huge gamer, I've been a gamer ever since I played Zelda on my GameCube all those years ago! I currently own a PS4
								and just finished Final Fantasy XV, which in my opinion is the best RPG available on the PS4. I also game on PC and usually play Skyrim, League
								of Legends, and Overwatch.</p>
